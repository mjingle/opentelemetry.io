## Security

When setting up the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector, consider implementing
security best practices in both your hosting infrastructure and your OTel
Collector configuration.

For implementing OTel Collector hosting infrastructure, refer to our
[Hosting Best Practices](/security/otel-collector-hosting-best-practices) guide.

For configuring your OTel Collector, refer to our
[Configuration Best Practices](/security/otel-collector-configuration-best-practices)
guide.

For Component Developers, refer to
[OTel Collector GitHub Repository's Security Best Practices](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/security-best-practices.md).
